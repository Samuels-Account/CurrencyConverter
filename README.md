# Currency Converter

This is a currency converter application that allows users to convert currencies from one denomination to another. It was built using Python, Pycharm, and the openexchangerates.org API.

The application retrieves real-time exchange rates and allows users to select the currency they want to convert from and the currency they want to convert to. The application then displays the converted amount.
